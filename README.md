A quick python script to convert raw json from Chrome Bookmarks to an importable Netscape Bookmark File.

The need arised while I was swapping my work-issued PC to a Mac and forgot to export my bookmarks. 

This was a quick way for the IT Department to send me the bookmarks file (located in C:\Users\<currentuser>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default).

While in most cases the file can just be added to the Mac equivalent path (/Users/<currentuser>/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default), I wanted to merge my old bookmarks with my new bookmarks.
